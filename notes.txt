Generate migration file:
    rails generate migration <name_for_migration_file>

Run the migration file:
    - rails will only run gigration that it hasn't ran yet
    - rails db:migrate

Rollback the migration file:
    - Undo last migration
    - rails db:rollback
    - preferred way is not to use rollback, but make a new migration file to reflect any modification in the database
